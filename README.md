## 🚀 The Mission
The gap between "Technical Reality" and "Business Strategy" is where security budgets die. **OCH CyberLingua** is a hybrid-AI application designed to fix this. 

It translates complex technical risks (like Agentic AI or Non-Human Identity) into the business language of Value, Impact, and Action.

## 🧠 The V.I.S.A. Framework
This engine is built upon the proprietary **V.I.S.A. Framework** for executive communication:

* **V**alue: What revenue stream or asset are we protecting?
* **I**mpact: The 4-Scenario Business Loss (Shutdown, Cleanup, Penalty, Exodus).
* **S**tory: A physical-world analogy that kills jargon.
* **A**ction: The specific strategic ask.

## ✨ Features
* **Hybrid Intelligence:** Uses a curated "Master Database" for instant, board-verified strategies.
* **Infinite Scope:** Integrates with **Google Gemini AI** to generate strategies for *any* emerging threat on the fly.
* **Role-Based Output:** Generates unique narratives for the Board, CFO, or Employees.
* **Privacy First:** API keys are stored locally in your browser (Client-Side) and never sent to a backend server.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1.  **Select a Topic:** Choose a trending threat (e.g., Ransomware) or type your own.
2.  **Select an Audience:** Calibrate the output for the Board, Finance, or Culture.
3.  **Translate:** The engine generates a "Campaign Kit" including a pitch script, analogies, and data proof.
